		<p>I'm happy you found my website. This website complies with all the standards, including having a header and a body section with some text, at least one image, and at least one table. Additionally, it has an external CSS file that is correctly linked to the webpage and contains at least five separate classes or IDs that alter the linked webpage's elements. The rest of the classes and IDs change characteristics like typefaces, colors, background-color, etc. whereas one class or ID controls layout using layers (Div tag).</p>
